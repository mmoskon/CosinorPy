# CosinorPy

CosinorPy presents a python package for cosinor based rhythmomethry. It is composed of three modules:
* [```file_parser```](docs\docs_file_parser.md): reading and writting xlsx or csv files and generating synthetic data

* [```cosinor```](docs\docs_cosinor.md): single- or multi-component cosinor functions

* [```cosinor1```](docs\docs_cosinor1.md): single-component cosinor specific functions

To use these three modules include the following code in your python file:

```from CosinorPy import file_parser, cosinor, cosinor1```

CosinorPy can be installed using ```pip``` with the command

```pip install CosinorPy```

This documentation describes the main functions for data import/export, cosinor regression and testing of differential rhythmicity.
